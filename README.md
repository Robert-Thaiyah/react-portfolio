## Overview

This is my personal portfolio created using HTML, TailwindCSS and Javascript. The project is a simple one and will take very many iterations as I
continue to learn new technologies.

## My process

- First I sought some samples from Dribbble but decided on using a simple approach on my profile, having only the skills, portfolio and contact pages.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- React

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind and HTML.
